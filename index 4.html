        Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds,
        they
        cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some
        cases
        of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal
        varieties
        can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and
        encephalomyelitis.

        Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and
        realm
        Riboviria.They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of
        helical symmetry.The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the
        largest among RNA viruses.[6] They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which
        in
        electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.</p>
